The lower bound: coding gets solved for everyone, the title \"software engineer\" starts to disappear, replaced by \"builder\" or \"product manager.\" The upper bound is \"a lot scarier\" — ASL4, where models become recursively self-improving. Anthropic's safety levels define strict criteria that must be met before releasing more capable models. Boris says if you overhear lunchroom conversations at Anthropic, people are talking about AI safety — \"this is really the thing that everyone cares about more than anything.\" Building the most capable coding agent and building the most cautious safety culture aren't contradictions at Anthropic — they're the same mission.","href":null}],"color":"default"}},{"object":"block","id":"30fe3dcd-5100-81e6-b1bd-c5c59a90a21c","parent":{"type":"page_id","page_id":"30fe3dcd-5100-81bc-bcdc-f3f6a18b7836"},"created_time":"2026-02-22T14:58:00.000Z","last_edited_time":"2026-02-22T14:58:00.000Z","created_by":{"object":"user","id":"7f97ee67-86aa-4254-a07b-42fd6c3d15a1"},"last_edited_by":{"object":"user","id":"7f97ee67-86aa-4254-a07b-42fd6c3d15a1"},"has_children":false,"archived":false,"in_trash":false,"type":"heading_2","heading_2":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"The Practitioner Consensus","link":null},"annotations":{"bold":false,"italic":false,"strikethrough":false,"underline":false,"code":false,"color":"default"},"plain_text":"The Practitioner Consensus","href":null}],"is_toggleable":false,"color":"default"}},{"object":"block","id":"30fe3dcd-5100-817e-9023-c901dc5d1599","parent":{"type":"page_id","page_id":"30fe3dcd-5100-81bc-bcdc-f3f6a18b7836"},"created_time":"2026-02-22T14:58:00.000Z","last_edited_time":"2026-02-22T14:58:00.000Z","created_by":{"object":"user","id":"7f97ee67-86aa-4254-a07b-42fd6c3d15a1"},"last_edited_by":{"object":"user","id":"7f97ee67-86aa-4254-a07b-42fd6c3d15a1"},"has_children":false,"archived":false,"in_trash":false,"type":"paragraph","paragraph":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"If it were just me saying this, you could dismiss it as personal bias.
