## Recent Projects

Recently I have been working on the following projects:

- [**ChuanhuGPT**](https://github.com/xingfanxia/ChuanhuChatGPT) A python webapp that enables users to interact with various kinds of LLMs from a single interface.

- Youtube Video Summarizer with Chapter and Timestamp

- [**MahjongDetection**](https://github.com/xingfanxia/mahjong_hand_detection) My first object detection project in a while, detect and recognize mahjong hands from a given image and calculate the score of the hand.



And a few interesting apps I deloyed, fee free to try it out! Thanks to GCP and Vercel for the low cost scale to 0 and free options. 😆
